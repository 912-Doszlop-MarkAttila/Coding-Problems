A C# program that attempts to separate the elements of an input array A into two disjoint lists B and C, such that the average of B is equal to the average of C.
It does this by recursively generating all possible combinations of B and C until one solution is found, adding one element from A to either B or C at each step, and
checking if the new lists have been visited before to avoid generating duplicate combinations.
